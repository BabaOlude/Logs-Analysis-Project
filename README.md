## Technologies That I Used

Python

PostgreSQL

Git Bash

## This tool produces answers to the following three questions based on the data in the database:

What are the most popular three articles of all time?

Who are the most popular articles authors of all time?

On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

## Getting Started

Open Terminal (Windows users - open Git Bash terminal that comes with the GIT software).

In the Terminal enter "psql -d news -f newsdata.sql" to connect to the database "news" and run sql commands.

Run the command " psql news" to open PostgreSQL command line program

After you created the view, exit PostgreSQL command line by running "\q" command.

To load the data, use the command psql -d news -f newsdata.sql to connect a database and run the necessary SQL statements.
